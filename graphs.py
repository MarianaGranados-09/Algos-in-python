#graphs- first graph algo called breadth-first search (BFS)

#Allows you to find the shortest distance between two things, the algo can
#be used for:

#Write a checkers AI that calculates the fewest moves to victory
#Write a spell checker
#Find the doctor closest to you in your network

#shortest-path problem
#1. model the problem as a graph
#2. solve the problem using breadth-first search

#What is a graph? A graph models a set of connections, each node is made
#up of nodes and edges, a node can be connected to many other nodes called 
#neighbors. 

#Breadth-first search:
#1. is there a path from node A to node B?
#2. What is the shortest path from node A to node B?

#Queues: are similar to stacks, you can't access random elements
#in the queue, instead, there are only 2 operations: enqueue and dequeue

#enqueue: add an item to the queue, dequeue: take an item off the queue

#queue: FIFO ds - first in, first out
#stack: LIFO ds - last in, first out
