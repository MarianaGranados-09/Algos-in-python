#dynamic programming is a technique used to solve a hard problem by
#breaking it up into subproblems and solving those subproblems first

#checking every set posible of goods will take o(2^n) time

#solving problem for smaller knapsnacks and then work up to solving the original
#problem, dynamic programming is a hard concept...

#every dynamic programming algo starts with a grid
#one row for each item to choose from-3
#columns for knapback sizes from 1 to 4 pounds - 4

#in dynamic programming, youre trying to maximize something
#trying to optimize something given a constraint
#every solution involves a grid
