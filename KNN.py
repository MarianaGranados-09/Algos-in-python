#k-nearest neighbors
#classification system using the k-nearest neighbors algo

#classification = categorization into a group
#regression = predicitng a response (like a number)

#Intro to machine learning through KNN

#OCR stands for optical character recognition, means taking a photo
#of a page of text and the computer automatically read the text for u

#How does OCR work? Using KNN
#1. Go through a lot of images of numbers, extract features of those
#numbers
#2. When u get a new image, extract the features of that image and
#see what its neareast neighbors are.

#Generally speaking, OCR algo measures lines, points and curves.
#The first step of OCR is called training, most ML algos have a training step

#Building a spam filter
#use another algo called the naive bayes classifier, first you train your
#naive bayes classifier on some data
